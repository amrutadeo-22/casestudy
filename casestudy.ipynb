Member users ride more often than casual riders, except on weekends and during the peak of the summer.\n3. Member users follow predictable paths from and to the city center, whereas Casual users ride closer to leisure areas and follow less predictable paths.\n\nWithout more information about the users, like age, job, or gender, we can only infer by the data provided.\n\n### Suggestion\n\nI would suggest focusing on targeting casual users, showing the benefits of becoming a member user, such as making a good environmental impact by using bike sharing to commute to work instead of using other types of transportation, or how much money they can save by becoming members and still use the service for both leisure and other type of activities.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Thanks for reading my case study.
